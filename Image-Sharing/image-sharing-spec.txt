OUTLINE
Make the next Imgur! Put together a platform that lets users upload images and see others' images. Users should be able to upvote/downvote images and add comments to others' images. They should also be able to add captions and tags to their own images.

ASSETS (provided to students):
- name (“PixE”)
- A base set of images to play around with (though feel free to others instead)

MUST-HAVE FEATURES:
- Front page must be able to show the highest-voted images from the last 24 hours
- Users must be able to log in; users who are not logged in can only browse (no uploading, commenting, or voting)
- Users must have usernames and avatars
- Logged-in users must be able to upload image files (with captions)
- Logged-in users must also be able to comment on, and upvote/downvote, other peoples’ images
- Logged-in users must also be able to comment on, and upvote/downvote, other users’ comments
- Logged-in users must be able to get notifications within the platform, and get these notifications under the following circumstances:
    * image owner gets notifications when comments are made on the image
    * commenters get notifications when comments are made on their comments, or when their comments get upvoted/downvoted

NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES:
- One or more photos can be uploaded via drag/drop to the site.
- Logged-in users are able to flag offensive images for moderation, and after 3 flags they are automatically hidden from the public.
- Users have the option to get notifications sent to them by email (with context; i.e. “User X replied to your comment, ‘Blah blah blah’ ”)
- Users have visible profiles, listing:
  > username
  > time in the service
  > optional blurb
  > optional avatar alongside comments; start with a defualt avatar if they don't choose one
  > interests
- Users can create ‘channels’ for specific categories of images, and browse all channels created by other users.
- Users can edit any of their photos on the platform:
  > Cropping
  > Applying ‘filters’
  > Doodling on top of them
