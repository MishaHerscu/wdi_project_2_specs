OUTLINE
Famed Boston bagel restaurant "Bob's Bagels" needs a new website with a full menu and an online order system for ordering either (1) bulk bagels, or (2) customizable bagel sandwiches (to which toppings can be added or removed, affecting the price of the sandwich). 

The order system *must* allow users to create orders, change them before paying, and finally pay by credit card (via Stripe). Bonus points [5] for allowing multiple people to contribute to the order, and saving orders for future use.

ASSETS (provided to students):
- name (“Bob’s Bagels”)
- menu, with prices (menu.txt)
- delivery information (delivery.txt)
- bio for Bob (bio.txt)

MUST-HAVE FEATURES:
- menu must be visible on the site
- Bob’s bio must be somewhere on the site
- users can place orders
- users can see an order history
- users can change orders before placing them
- users can customize sandwiches by adding items (increasing the price) or removing items (not affecting the price)

NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES:
- users can enter promotional discount codes for their orders
- two different user paths for buying sandwiches vs bulk bagels (enterprise client)
- an API, which could be used for an admin view, or could plug into an inventory management system
- rotating weekly specials
